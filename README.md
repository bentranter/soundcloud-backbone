##Fun with Backbone.js and the Soundcloud API

Sometimes when you're working on a larger project, and you get stuck on something, it's easier to recreate that situation in a small project. Once you've got it figured out, you can use that same solution in your big project. This is my small project.

####Usage

The same as any old project,

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bentranter/soundcloud-backbone.git
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

I used live-server, so this will just open your browser for you and probably start playing music, so you might want to turn your speakers down 😁.


####TODO:

- test against 4G connection
- test against embedded WebKit wth and without JIT
